            It's not been so long in this server for me. I see it pretty cool
            ngl cuz uk when someone enters a server some members start bullying
            the person and make them feel offended which is not here and people
            are pretty cool bout everything and not getting offended . I will
            suggest to enter the server to everyone cuz its likes goes really
            well with all. Everyone tries to match the vibe. And yeah of course
            they don't fight which actually happens in most of server.In short,
            imma say it's a really nice server.

            It's been a year I have been in brewdi√©s server and I cannot forgot
            the moments I lived here, the moments I enjoyed here with friends.
            Brewdi√©s is not just a server for me, it's like a e-family for me
            whenever I am on my phone the family I am with is brewdi√©s. The
            friendly environment and the humble staff are the best things about
            the server in short this is a non toxic friendly server, people can
            make friends, can do fun in general chat or in bots section. The
            owner of this server omega is my friend and he is friend of the
            every member of the server and very kind though and he also hosts
            nitro giveaways and more giveaways too. If you are looking for a
            family server brewdi√©s will be your first choice give this server a
            try you won't regret. That's all Welcome to Brewdi√©s Community

            Discord is a place to wind down at the end of a stressful day and
            for many it's a mechanism to detach from grueling reality. Brewdi√©s
            is a place where all are welcome and no discrimination of any kind
            is tolerable. The administration is not as rigid as to suck the fun
            out of the server but also great at making members follow the
            discord community guidelines at the same time. lively banter and non
            offensive jokes are part of the servers at all times. It's a
            surefire way too have an amazing time.

            I've been a member of the Brewdies for a few months now, and I've
            had a great time. The community is really friendly and welcoming,
            and there's always someone to talk to. Whether you're looking for
            someone to play games with, chat about your hobbies, or just vent
            about your day, you'll find a friend in Brewdies.

            Alright,So it's been almost 1.5 years since I have joined
            Brewdies.At that time I was looking for a friendly,non-toxic server
            where I could meet new people ,make friends and can do all the
            shenanigans,But in the end I've ended up making a new family which
            is shocking for me aswell.I have used discord for almost 3 years but
            never encountered any server equivalent to Brewdies.This server has
            given me so many memories that I can't repay back with any sort of
            currency existing in this world.I've seen ups and downs of this
            server with my very own eyes but never ever civilains of this
            beautiful town brewdi√©s lost their kindness,compassion and
            smile.So,for me this was the best time i could ever had,hope you
            guys can experience that aswell ^_^ peace.
